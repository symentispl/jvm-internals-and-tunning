If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough.

Have you ever wondered what does it take to make your software run faster?
Have you ever wondered what does it take to become a "performance engineer"?
Or you are doing so-called "adhoc" performance tunning, living your life from
on outage to another severity 1? And you have this strange feeling, that this
not like things should be?

You have never cared about how your code performance. You knew it is always
problem with database (or somebody's else problem, blaming other's is easy).
It is just hard to admit that you don't know how to make your code run faster.

Let me be your guide on a trip. I will show you how to, accompanied by tools
like JMH, JFR and flamegraphs, make your code run faster. We will not only focus on tooling but also on
performance tunning process. We are going to talk about times when benchmarks lie,
why data sets are crucial and when more doesn't mean faster.

During the whole presentation, we will be refactoring and improving the
performance of one, not so trivial code example. Something that everybody knows and something
that is fun to implement on your own.

Benchmark, profile, refactor, repeat.
