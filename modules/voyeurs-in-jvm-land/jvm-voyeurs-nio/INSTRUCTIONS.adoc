## example 5 (NIO (vectored IO))

### how to run it?

	./example5 &> /dev/null &

### how to diagnose it?

first run `top` and you will see, that this process generates a lot of iowait.

if this io wait, this can be only one ;)

	pidstat -d -p [pid] 1

you will see a loads of writes, but not reads, good so this process is only writing files.
Seriously? don't believe everything you see:).

Let's dig deeper,

	sysdig proc.pid=[pid] and event.type=write

shit... ok, we have writes that's cool, but what about reads:

	sysdig proc.pid=[pid] and event.type=read

oops we have a lots of `read`, but process (pidstat) doesn't consume IOPS. We love you Linux (caching).

### a twist

is this all? unfortunately not ;). let's see which files and directories are being read and written

	lsof -p 13702

bang, nothing.

	sysdig -c spy_file proc.pid=[pid]

we see that this process writes 0.5MB files to one directory, and 5MB to another, let's try to see it,

	sysdig proc.pid=[pid] and evt.type=write and fd.directory=[directory]

wait, why there are no writes to a second directory?

	sysdig proc.pid=[pid] and evt.is_write_io=true and fd.directory=[directory]

Yes, there is a special syscall, called `writev`, so called vectored IO.
