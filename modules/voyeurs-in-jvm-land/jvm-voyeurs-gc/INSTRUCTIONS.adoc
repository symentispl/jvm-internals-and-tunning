## example 1 (GC)

### how to run it?

	./example1 &> /dev/null &

### how to diagnose it?

first check `top`, and see that this application consumes CPU, both sys and user time

let's check what the process does:

	jstack [pid]

you will see a couple of threads, busy and spinning.

let's see heap usage.

	jmap -heap [pid]
	jmap -histo [pid]

nothing unusual.

So no IO activity, so let's take look what the process does:

	sysdig proc.pid=[pid]

lots of `futex` and `mprotect` calls.

futex means locks, this confirms as we have many threads running, but what is `mprotect`.
It is use for "safepoint" mechanism. When safepoints are used? GC?

Let's check GC activity.

	jstat -gcutil [pid] 1000
