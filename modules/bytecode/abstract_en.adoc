If these things don't mean anything to you, but at the same time you have
this strange feeling deep inside you, that you should know it by heart,
come to this talk.
Want to understand how component scan works in Spring? What nasty things
Hibernate does to your lovely entity classes? And how AspectJ works underneath?
If an answer to any of above questions is true, you should feel welcomed to
journey through bytecode, stacks, local variable tables and class file format.
I am going to unveil some of the JVM bytecode fundamentals, how it works,
why some things feel weird and show few tools how to play with bytecode in
a warmth of your desk. I promise to not hurt any animals during my presentation,
except ASM, ByeBuddy and Byteman. And yes, I did it few times in production,
for better good of humanity.
