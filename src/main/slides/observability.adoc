== JDK with batteries included

* jps
* jmap
* jstack
* jstat
* jcmd

=== how it works

JVM stores metrics in memory mapped files

_+++/tmp/hsperfdata_[username]/[pid]+++_

=== test

_lsof +d /tmp/hsperfdata_jarek_

=== jps

lists all running JVM processes

=== jstack

dumps stacks of all JVM threads (in a selected process)

_jstack -l [pid] # to include locks info_

=== jmap

prints heap information, histogram or dump heap content to a file

=== !

_jmap -heap [pid] # to print heap usage_

_jmap -histo [pid] # to print histogram_

_jmap -dump:file=jvm.dump # to dump heap_

=== jstat

samples running JVM for selected metrics

_jstat -gc [pid] 1000_

=== what?

[quote,Nitsan Wakart,]
  Imagine if you will a JVM full of mutator threads, all busy, sweating, mutating the heap. Some of them have <gasp> shared mutable state. They're mutating each others state, concurrently, like animals. Some stand in corners mutating their own state (go blind they will). Suddenly a neon sign flashes the word PINEAPPLES. One by one the mutators stop their rampant heap romping and wait, sweat dripping. When the last mutator stops, a bunch of elves come in, empty the ashtrays, fill up all the drinks, mop up the puddles, and quickly as they can they vanish back to the north pole. The sign is turned off and the threads go back to it

=== !

[quote,Nitsan Wakart,]
  At a safepoint the mutator thread is at a known and well defined point in it's interaction with the heap. This means that all the references on the stack are mapped (at known locations) and the JVM can account for all of them. As long as the thread remains at a safepoint we can safely manipulate the heap + stack such that the thread's view of the world remains consistent when it leaves the safepoint.

=== TLAB

image::https://static.pexels.com/photos/533353/pexels-photo-533353.jpeg[background,size=cover]

=== what?

[quote,Ross K,]
  A Thread Local Allocation Buffer (TLAB) is a region of Eden that is used for allocation by a single thread.  It enables a thread to do object allocation using thread local top and limit pointers, which is faster than doing an atomic operation on a top pointer that is shared across threads. A thread acquires a TLAB at it's first object allocation after a GC scavenge. The size of the TLAB is computed via a somewhat complex process discribed below.  The TLAB is released when it is full (or nearly so), or the next GC scavenge occurs. TLABs are allocated only in Eden, never from From-Space or the OldGen.

=== should I care?

you want as much of allocations to happen in TLABs, period

=== FlightRecorder

[quote,,Oracle Help Center]
Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application. It is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and causes almost no performance overhead, so it can be used even in heavily loaded production environments.

[%notitle]
=== enable JFR

=== warning

as of now, you can't use it to analyze production systems

this is official statement now

_pidstat -t -w -p [pid] 1 # task switching per thread_ +
_pidstat -r -p [pid] 1 # page faults per process_

forget about `strace`, `ptrace` syscall is not what you want :)

== tools for weirdos

* honest profiler
* flamegraphs

=== honest profiler

it uses unofficial JVM API call `AsyncGetCallTrace` +
as opposed to other profilers which use JVMTI (JVM tool interface)

=== !

here goes long boring discussion about complexity of OpenJDK global safepoint mechanism

[%notitle]
=== honest profiler benefits

[quote,,Honest profiler wiki]
  It accurately profiles applications, avoiding an inherent bias towards places that have safepoints.
  It profiles applications with significantly lower overhead than traditional profiling techniques, making it suitable for use in production.
