== about me

*Jarek Pa≈Çka*

[options="step"]
* Allegro.tech, doing stuff, back to coding, hell yeah!!!
* JDD, 4Developers and one more conference (still under development) where I
serve as a dictator for life
* JVM, bytecode, parsers, graphs and other cool things (like ponies)
* owner at Symentis trainings,
* former chief architect, development manager, head of development,
backend developer and performance guy

== agenda

* JDK with batteries included
* JVM logging and tracking
* Linux tools for curious
* other tools for weirdos

== JDK with batteries included

* jps
* jmap
* jstack
* jcmd

=== how it works

JVM stores metrics in memory mapped files

_+++/tmp/hsperfdata_[username]/[pid]+++_

=== test

_lsof +d /tmp/hsperfdata_jarek_

=== jps

lists all running JVM processes

=== jstack

dumps stacks of all JVM threads (in a selected process)

_jstack -l [pid] # to include locks info_

=== jmap

prints heap information, histogram or dump heap content to a file

=== !

_jmap -heap [pid] # to print heap usage_

_jmap -histo [pid] # to print histogram_

_jmap -dump:file=jvm.dump # to dump heap_

=== jstat

samples running JVM for selected metrics

=== jcmd

[%notitle]
=== jcmd - options

one tool to rule them all, +
one stop shop for all commands available in JVM

=== let's play with it

== JVM logging and tracking

=== JVM has tons of diagnostic options

=== garbage collection

=== safepoint

=== just in time compilation

=== native memory tracking

== Linux tools for curious

* sysstat
* sysdig
* perf

== a weapon of massive distraction

=== or pair made in heaven

=== FlightRecorder

=== Java Mission Control

== tools for weirdos

* honest profiler
* flamegraphs
* PrintAssembly?

=== honest profiler

it uses unofficial JVM API call `AsyncGetCallTrace` +
as opposed to other profilers which use JVMTI (JVM tool interface)

=== !

here goes long boring discussion about complexity of OpenJDK global safepoint mechanism

[%notitle]
=== honest profiler benefits

[quote,,Honest profiler wiki]
  It accurately profiles applications, avoiding an inherent bias towards places that have safepoints.
  It profiles applications with significantly lower overhead than traditional profiling techniques, making it suitable for use in production.

== tools I didn't mention

* GCviewer
* JITWatch

== Q&A
